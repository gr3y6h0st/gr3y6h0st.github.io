### I got in. At the beginning of June, Google sent out sign ups to attend their Google Cloud Learning Workshop, an 8-week long mix of online and in-person learning sessions that provide insight what it takes to be a Customer and Sales Engineer in the cloud industry. 
For more information visit <https://events.withgoogle.com/sf-cloud-learning-workshop/#content>

Summary: The Program will provide participants free access to Coursera's Architecting with Google Cloud Platform specialization. Participants will be required to complete certain sections prior to each in-person session hosted at Google's SF office. I imagine the in-person sessions will be a chance to network and go over the self-paced material and provide participants challenges and opportunities to collaborate and discuss the content more in-depth at the venue.

At the end of the program, individuals determined to take the Cloud Certification Exam soon after will be offered a subsidy by Google for the cost of the certification. That's a pretty sweet deal.

Pretty excited to learn GCP and add this to my growing list of skills. Let's. Get. This.

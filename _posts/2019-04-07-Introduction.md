## First Post: A little bit about Me!

Hey there!

I'm Jayvy, a SF Bay Area native and an aspiring self-taught, Android Developer looking to take the next step by pursuing professional Android roles.

My road to Android began in 2016 with Udacity's Android Basics: Nanodegree, a beginner-friendly intro course for those looking to dive in to the world of Android. 

By mid-2017, I had finished the program and began making arrangements to moving up to their "career-ready" Android Nanodegree curriculum. 

Fortunately, Google had initiated a co-sponsored partnership with Udacity through a program called the Grow with Google Challenge around the same time. I decided to give it my best shot. Why not?

So I joined...

...got selected as a scholar! (WhooooHOOOOO!)...

...and graduated the Android Nanodegree Program as of November 2018!

However, as anyone in the tech industry knows, things constantly evolve and do so at a rapid rate! 

I'll be using this site to document and showcase my work throughout my journey to understanding and keeping pace with the latest libraries and methodologies in Android Development. In the future, I plan to use follow up posts to tease the projects I've been (or will be) working on. Checkout my projects page for a more visual look at my work. My Github will also be available in my info section for anyone trying to get an in-depth look at my code.

If you got this far. Thanks for reading! :)

Brb. Getting back to the grind.

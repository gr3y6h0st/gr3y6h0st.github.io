More eager and curious users can take their learning a step further by accessing the app's Hiragana Syllabary, which provides an audio sample of each Hirgana character's phonetic pronunciation and a respective GIF Image visual of their stroke order patterns.

Lastly, the app does provide a English -> Japanese translation feature based off Google's Cloud Translate API. In its current form, the sole purpose is to provide a simple method of translation for any material not covered by the app or too complex for novice-level Japanese speakers.
